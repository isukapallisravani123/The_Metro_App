**Data Structures Used**:

**Graph (defaultdict)**: 
Used to represent the transportation network where each station is a key mapped to a list of tuples containing neighboring stations, distances, and times.

**Directed Edges (set)**: 
Stores one-way connections between stations to handle directed edges in the graph.

**Algorithms Used**:

**Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path (Min Distance)**:
Finds the shortest path between two stations based on the minimum distance traveled. Implemented using a priority queue (heap) to efficiently explore neighboring stations.

**Dijkstra's Algorithm for Shortest Path (Min Time)**:
Similar to the previous algorithm but considers time instead of distance, finding the path with the minimum travel time.
